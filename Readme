Can we please have aeson (or something) for query strings?

Like when you have QueryText ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-types-0.12.3/docs/Network-HTTP-Types-URI.html#t:QueryText ) and the type which you want to parse it to you just run the thing and it does the job.

Can it be possible with further constraints?

0. Works only with type that has one constructor.
1. Same field names as in query string keys.
2. Only first key-value pair from the left will be processed.


Things to achieve the goal:

- extract constructor field names
- extract constructor field types
- â€¦
