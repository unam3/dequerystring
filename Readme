Can we please have aeson (or something) for query strings?

Like when you have QueryText ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-types-0.12.3/docs/Network-HTTP-Types-URI.html#t:QueryText ) and the type which you want to parse it to you just run the thing and it does the job.

Can it be possible with further constraints?

0. We do not care for keys without fields: someKeyWithoutValue will be ignored in goo.gl/?someKeyWithoutValue .
1. Only the first key-value pair from the left with the same key will be processed.
